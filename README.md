# Work Sample for Product Engineer

Thank you for your interest in our company. Below are the requirements for a work sample that will help us assess your skills.

**Problems:**

This is a template that includes TailwindCSS which we use in our product. We want to enhance it to be more user-friendly and interactive.

**Loading Spinner:** Replace the existing loading spinner with a picture or animation of your choice.

**Data Table:** Create a page with a client-side data table based on the data in the JSON file `db/data.json`. You can use axios or fetch to retrieve the data.

Implement a table that displays the data from the JSON file.

Ensure the table is styled with TailwindCSS.

**Bonus:**

**Sorting:** Enable sorting of the data by clicking on the column headers.

**Editing**: Add a button to each row that allows users to edit the row's data. Provide a save button to persist the changes. For the purpose of this sample, you can either save the changes or log the updated data to the console.

**Additional Notes:**

You are free to use any library or framework you prefer, but we recommend using Tailwind UI or similar TailwindCSS-based components.

Ensure that your code is clean, maintainable, and well-documented.

We look forward to seeing your work!
